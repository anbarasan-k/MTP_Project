Testing of web applications would have become manageable if we had a functional specification of web applications. Due to the underlying issues with browsers and applications being patched regularly it is almost impossible to set realistic functional specifications and system specifications. Thus, vulnerability scanners to test web security will result in false positives, or false negatives. The above disadvantages can be circumvented by model-based testing approach. In this dissertation, we propose a method for web application security using model-based testing approach. The proposed method has been implemented and tested. Model-based testing approach is adapted as it is easy to automate the testing process, and adaptive to changes. Some of the modelling tools like WebSphinx, and PHP-Crawler generate a model based on the static elements in web page. Modern web applications are dynamic in nature due to AJAX technology. Our approach, uses crawljax, a open source modelling tool, and generates a model based on dynamic event handler, then generates test cases for security based on the model of the web application, and execute them in a browser to validate the model for security vulnerabilities. Our case study of DVWA-Damn Vulnerable Web Application that contains security vulnerabilities has shown advantages of our tool approach. We have performed experiments with our test framework in a sample space of 15 web applications. We opine that our testing tool is capable of capturing security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL Injection in the tested web applications in an automated manner.
