\chapter{CONCLUSION}

Web application vulnerability scanners generate few false positive and false negative results. This can be avoided by blackbox model based security testing. To model the web application, different types of Web Application modelling techniques is discussed. The State machine model based on DOM tree is chosen as the model for model based testing since it is flexible for modern web applications. Since SQLI and XSS are the most common security threats, these two attack scenarios have been chosen as attack models. The test suite is generated with the architecture model against the attack models. The attack pattern is executed in an automated manner against the web application.
