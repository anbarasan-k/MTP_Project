\chapter{FUTURE WORK}
The security test framework in this thesis focus on the major security threat vulnerabilities-XSS and SQL Injection attacks.The current framework does not consider security attacks such as LDAP Injection, Broken Authentication and session Management. The challenges in detecting these attacks are the session IDs and authorization tokes expires within a time frame for web applications and brute force techniques are not effective in discovering these vulnerabilities. The techniques to detect these vulnerabilites are in future scope. Our scope of executing the security testing is within headless browsers and extending it to browsers with UI by bypassing security configurations of browsers is of future scope.
